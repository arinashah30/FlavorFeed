FlavorFeed is a social media app designed for sharing your favorite meals with friends. Here's how it works:

• Post Your Meals: Users can share a picture of their food and who they're dining with up to three times a day for each meal.

• Enhance Your Posts: When posting a meal, users have the option to include the recipe they used or tag the restaurant they're dining at.

• Explore the Main Feed: Scroll through the main feed to view friends' posts for the day.

• Pin Your Favorites: Users can pin their favorite posts, which will be shown on their public profile.

• View Your Culinary Journey: User profiles include a map of the locations of your previous restaurant-tagged posts.

Discover the joy of sharing meals with FlavorFeed, where "phone eats first" is always true!
